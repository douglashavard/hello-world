# hello-world

Hi AP CS Students!

Mr. Havard here. I'm thrilled to introduce you to GitHub as our course workflow resource for large- and small-scale programming projects. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to work in teams to solve complex problems of meaning to you and of historical significance. Whether forking some initial code and building upon this code to construct a chatbot, designing two-dimensional media, creating games, or solving human-centered problems this is our main tool for workflow and collaboration. Enjoy, have fun, and good luck!
